Explain your understanding of the code that transforms A/D counts
into engineering units:


  The math part is analogRead(analoginPin)*100*1.1/1023 - 50.
 
  Since we use analogReference(INTERNAL), the range for analogRead is 0 - 1.1V.
 And analogRead() returns a value between 0 - 1023. 
   So analogRead(analoginPin)/1023 yields the percentage of the input voltage out of the whole input range, which is 1.1V. 
   Thus, analogRead(analoginPin)/1023*1.1 yields the real input voltage. 100 is approximation of the increase in degree celsius per increase in voltage.
   -50 is the temperature in degree celsius we get when the input is 0V.
   analogRead(analoginPin)*100*1.1/1023 - 50, as a result, tells us the temperature in degree celsius.




How many values did you average to get a reasonably stable temperature?

10


Did you compute the average in A/D counts and then convert to temperature,
or did you convert first and compute the average using temperature values?
    

We convert the raw value into the temperature first, then compute the average.
