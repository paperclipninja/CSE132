1. The program does not maintain the timing specification, it does not take into account the time needed to run the program. 

2. With a larger filter size the filtered data became more stable and changes in temperature were more linear. 

3. The program maintains timing specification much better with delta time however there is still some deviation.

4. The response of the program with delta time to a doubling of the filter was very similiar to that of the program without delta time. Doubling the filter time made the filtered data much more stable.
